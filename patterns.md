# Production Design Patterns for SpaceML Library

## üéØ Learning Objective
Transform prototype functions into production-ready classes following established patterns in the `coordinate_transforms.py` module.

## üìã The SpaceML Pattern (Proven Production Template)

Your `coordinate_transforms.py` already demonstrates excellent production patterns:

### **Pattern Components:**

```python
# 1. IMMUTABLE DATA CLASSES
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Vector3D:
    x: float
    y: float
    z: float
    frame: ReferenceFrame
    timestamp: datetime = field(default_factory=...)

    def __post_init__(self):
        # Validation logic here
```

### **2. ENUMS FOR TYPE SAFETY**
```python
class ReferenceFrame(Enum):
    ECI = "Earth-Centred Inertial"
    ECEF = "Earth-Centred Earth-Fixed"
```

### **3. REGISTRY PATTERN**
```python
class CoordinateTransforms:
    def __init__(self):
        self.transformations = {}  # Registry
        self._register_default_transformations()

    def transform(self, vector, target_frame):
        # Look up transformation from registry
        # Apply it
```

### **4. INDIVIDUAL TRANSFORM CLASSES**
```python
class EciToEcefTransform:
    def transform(self, vector: Vector3D) -> Vector3D:
        # Specific transformation logic
```

## üîÑ Function ‚Üí Production Class Translation Strategy

### **Your Current Functions:**
- `constraint_matrix(positions, "efficiency")`
- `constraint_matrix(positions, "redundancy")`
- `communication_matrix(positions)`
- `combined_matrix(positions, weights)`
- `objective(positions, weights)`
- `optimise_satellite_positions(positions, weights)`

### **Production Class Structure:**
```python
# Data classes (immutable)
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SatellitePosition: ...

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ConstellationState: ...

# Individual constraint classes (like EciToEcefTransform)
class EfficiencyConstraint:
    def calculate_matrix(self, constellation) -> np.ndarray:
        # YOUR constraint_matrix("efficiency") code here

class RedundancyConstraint:
    def calculate_matrix(self, constellation) -> np.ndarray:
        # YOUR constraint_matrix("redundancy") code here

class CommunicationConstraint:
    def calculate_matrix(self, constellation) -> np.ndarray:
        # YOUR communication_matrix() code here

# Main interface (like CoordinateTransforms)
class ConstellationOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.constraints = {}  # Registry
        self._register_default_constraints()

    def optimize(self, constellation, weights):
        # YOUR optimise_satellite_positions() code here
```

## üèóÔ∏è Why This Pattern Works for Production

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each constraint class has ONE job
- Easy to test, debug, and maintain

### **2. Extensibility**
- Add new constraints without modifying existing code
- Registry pattern supports plugins

### **3. Immutability**
- `frozen=True` prevents accidental mutations
- Safer for concurrent operations

### **4. Type Safety**
- Enums prevent typos (`ConstraintType.EFFICIENCY` vs `"efficiency"`)
- Dataclass validation catches errors early

### **5. Composition over Inheritance**
- Flexible, testable architecture
- Easier to reason about than deep inheritance hierarchies

## üìö Translation Checklist

### **Step 1: Identify Data Structures**
- [ ] What are your core data types? (positions, constellations, weights)
- [ ] What validation is needed?
- [ ] What should be immutable?

### **Step 2: Extract Individual Components**
- [ ] Which functions do similar things? (constraint calculations)
- [ ] How can they be grouped into classes?
- [ ] What's the interface between them?

### **Step 3: Create Registry**
- [ ] What needs to be extensible? (constraint types)
- [ ] How will components be looked up?
- [ ] What's the main user interface?

### **Step 4: Maintain Existing Logic**
- [ ] Your working math stays the same!
- [ ] Just wrap it in better structure
- [ ] Test that results match prototype

## üéØ Next Session Plan

### **Phase 1: Data Structures (15 mins)**
1. Create `SatellitePosition` dataclass
2. Create `ConstellationState` dataclass
3. Create `OptimizationWeights` dataclass
4. Add validation and enums

### **Phase 2: Constraint Classes (30 mins)**
1. Create `EfficiencyConstraint` class
2. Move your `constraint_matrix("efficiency")` code to `calculate_matrix()` method
3. Create `RedundancyConstraint` class
4. Move your `constraint_matrix("redundancy")` code
5. Create `CommunicationConstraint` class
6. Move your `communication_matrix()` code

### **Phase 3: Main Optimizer (20 mins)**
1. Create `ConstellationOptimizer` class
2. Set up registry pattern
3. Move your `optimise_satellite_positions()` logic to `optimize()` method
4. Test against your working prototype

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation (15 mins)**
1. Verify results match your notebook
2. Test different constraint combinations
3. Validate immutability and type safety

## üí° Key Learning Points

### **Pattern Recognition**
- Registry pattern appears everywhere in production systems
- Immutable data prevents entire classes of bugs
- Type safety catches errors at development time, not runtime

### **Code Organization**
- Small, focused classes are easier to understand and test
- Composition allows flexible combinations
- Clear interfaces make code self-documenting

### **Production Mindset**
- Think about extensibility from day one
- Validation and error handling are first-class concerns
- Structure code for the next developer (including future you)
